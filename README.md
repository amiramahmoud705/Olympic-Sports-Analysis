# Olympic-Sports-Analysis
# Explanation of the Olympic Sports Analysis Project
This project is a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the history of the modern Olympic Games. The goal was to explore a rich historical dataset to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and insights about athlete performance, national dominance, and the evolution of the Games over time.

## Key Objectives & Analysis Performed:

## Data Preparation & Cleaning:

Merged Datasets: Combined an athlete information dataset with a results dataset (containing medals) using a unique key (like athlete ID) to create a unified, analysis-ready dataset.

Handled Data Quality: Addressed missing values, standardized country names (e.g., accounting for historical name changes like 'URS' to 'Russia'), and ensured data consistency for accurate analysis.

## Historical Trends Analysis:

Medal Tally Over Time: Analyzed the total number of medals awarded in each Olympic edition to visualize the growth of the Games.

Number of Participating Nations: Tracked how global participation has increased since 1896, highlighting the Olympics' expanding reach.

## Nation-Based Performance:

Overall Medal Leaderboard: Identified the top-performing countries of all time based on total medal counts.

Analysis of Dominant Nations: Delved into the historical performance of powerhouses like the USA, including their best-performing sports and trends over decades.

## Athlete Analysis:

Top Athletes: Identified and highlighted the most decorated athletes in Olympic history.

Age & Physical Attributes: Explored distributions of athlete age, height, and weight across different sports, uncovering the physical profiles associated with success in various disciplines.

## Sport-Specific Insights:

Analyzed which sports have the most events and offer the most medals.

Explored gender participation trends within different sports over time.

## Data Visualization:

Utilized Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn) to create a suite of visualizations, including:

Line charts to show trends over time.

Bar charts and horizontal bars to compare medal counts between countries and athletes.

Histograms and boxplots to analyze athlete demographics.

Key Skills Demonstrated: Data Wrangling & Merging, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Trend Analysis, Data Visualization, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Deriving Insights from Complex Datasets.
